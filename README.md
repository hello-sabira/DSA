# Data Structures & Algorithms
Keeping track of each and every Data Structures and Algorithms concept I come across. </br>
Uploading them on github so that I can still review everything in case I lose my device during a zombie apocalypse. </br>
Now ain't that smart?</br>
<i>Point to be noted though, all codes are not exclusively mine. Since I'm new to DSA, I chose/wrote code, edited, added comments for clarity (and my sanity) from various resources on the internet that helped me understand these concepts the most, in a simple, clear way. That's it</i>
